# Export to PDF
You can convert web pages to PDF from popular browsers like Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome by installing a PDF creator that works as a virtual PDF printer. Once the printer is installed, you can simply print to it and a PDF file will be generated. 

 * Convert a web page to PDF from Google Chrome on MacOS:
     - Click **File** - **Print...** (or press ⌘+P)
     - Choose **Open PDF in Preview**
